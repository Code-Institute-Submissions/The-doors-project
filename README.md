<h1> The Doors </h1>

The Doors

a page for an 60's band called The Doors, hoping to draw in fans of the band in 
to experience the impact the short lived but highly popular band had durring its time

<h2> UX </h2>

my UX process was pretty fast but alot of changes and editing during actual development.
Starting off with two rough wireframes made in adobe wireframe tool, i made two designs for desktop and one for mobile
but really only kept the mobile design and the two desktop were pretty much reworked, to the point. To the point i scrapped everything
and started over again when i knew how i really wanted my page to look and not being happy with the current work i had done.
Taking a on board a few things that my mentor victor shared with me, I took most of my mind set from the whiskey page section in the
course and the site shared to me (http://thekills.tv/). I took a more mobile first mind set and i prefer how it looks on a phone
then desktop but i wanted to keep it simple aswell. Many times i had to redo pages from all over when things were not working.
Finally finishing on something that i think looks good, both on mobile and pc, and while the images on tablet could be better its not causing any
issues nor is totally ugly to look at. the wireframes i used at first were pretty quick mock ups after looking at a few sites i ended up pretty 
much going in my own direction with the idea in my head.

as you can see i from my wireframes i first came up with and my final webpage had changed a fair bit, making things more simple for myself.

<h2> Technologies Used <h2>

 1.Bootstrap for its simple and ease of use for me and i most familar with it by now
 2.MaxCDN for a java script on advice for my mentor 

<h2> Testing </h2> 

Starting out firstly by seeing if every link works, and then seeing if every page loads quickly with no 
issues. Trying it also on each different setting for mobile and tablet the same run. Even using an actual phone to see how it would
work on a phone and the speed at which everything loads at.

Then secondly using both html and css validators, while alot of warning and errors came up due to using bootstrap 
codes, there was some things it told me that helped out, empty id's used and unnecessary code leftovers (e.g extra /div's' that were forgotten.)

<h2> Deployment </h2>

will be on git hub, other then that there wasnt really much else i did, this part might be updated later on when i know more about deployment
