The Doors

a page for an 60's band called The Doors, hoping to draw in fans of the band in 
to experience the impact the short lived but highly popular band had durring its time

<h2> UX </h2>

my UX process was pretty fast but alot of changes and editing during actual development.
Starting off with two rough wireframes made in adobe wireframe tool, i made two designs for desktop and one for mobile
but really only kept the mobile design and the two desktop were pretty much reworked, to the point. To the point i scrapped everything
and started over again when i knew how i really wanted my page to look and not being happy with the current work i had done.
